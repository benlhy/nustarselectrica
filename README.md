	a. ~~Test PWM~~
	b. ~~Test Direction~~
	c. Test PID control
2. ~~Sensor functions~~
	a. ~~Combine sensors~~
	b. Integrate sensors into PID 
3. ~~Radio functions~~
	a. ~~Send update to groundstation via radio~~
	b. ~~Update code on microcontroller from groundstation~~
	c. ~~Update sent value from groundstation and send back~~
	d. ~~Create a security value~~
4. Manual override
